# London-Borough-Crime

Here is my interpretation of the London Crime analysis dataset focusing on crime in London boroughs over the past 24 months. You can explore my Dashboard via this [link.](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/charles.muiruri/vizzes)

This dataset records the count of crimes monthly that was taken place in all 33 London Boroughs. I will be analysing this at Borough and Ward Level.

- Borough Level:
A large administrative division within a city or town such as Camden or Hackney in London
  

- Ward Level:
A smaller administrative unit within a borough or district, often representing a specific community or neighborhood i.e Camden is divided into wards like Bloomsbury, Camden Town, and Kentish Town

## What is the purpose of Analysing Crime in London?

Crime rates are crucial indicators of societal well-being, impacting public safety and economic development. My dashboard aims to dissect crime statistics, offering detailed and interactive visualisations of crime rates across London's boroughs.

This Dashbboard sheds light on the diversity and discrepancies in crime rates among boroughs, pinpointing areas of concern and those with lower crime incidence which allows residents, policymakers, and law enforcement agencies to understand the specific dynamics at play within each borough. In addition to this, by presenting data in an accessible format, the dashboard becomes a valuable tool for strategic planning and resource allocation enabling ervice areas to tailor their approaches, whether through increasing police presence in high-crime areas, implementing community programs for crime prevention, or reallocating resources to support initiatives aimed at reducing crime in the most affected boroughs.

This London crime borough dashboard is a catalyst for informed decision-making and proactive measures to enhance the safety and quality of life for all London boroughs.


## Script

The analysis presented was conducted using RStudio covering data preparation tasks such as cleansing, filtering, and statistical analysis. This process enabled the identification of trends and patterns within boroughs and crime types which is important as It allows us to extrapolate future trends from historical data, thus enhancing predictive analysis.

## Additional Notes

- **Please** make sure to read the accompanying files that provide detailed instructions on how to use, download and run the code.
- The dataset updates Monthly so refreshing script would be necessary.
